# Java-Socket-Docs

Here's an example implementation of a Java class called SocketAsyncConnectionChannel that connects to a server using a TLS socket connection. It handles Socket Connection Exception and tries to connect to the server three times before logging the failed reason message to logs:

java
Copy code
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketAddress;
import java.net.SocketException;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class SocketAsyncConnectionChannel {
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(SocketAsyncConnectionChannel.class.getName());
    private static final int MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS = 3;
    private final String host;
    private final int port;
    private Socket socket;
    
    public SocketAsyncConnectionChannel(String host, int port) {
        this.host = host;
        this.port = port;
    }

    public void connect() {
        int attempts = 0;
        while (attempts < MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS) {
            try {
                SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
                SocketAddress socketAddress = new InetSocketAddress(host, port);
                socket = sslSocketFactory.createSocket();
                socket.connect(socketAddress);
                logger.log(Level.INFO, "Successfully connected to the server.");
                break;
            } catch (SocketException e) {
                attempts++;
                logger.log(Level.WARNING, "SocketException occurred while connecting to the server. Reason: " + e.getMessage());
                if (attempts >= MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS) {
                    logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "Failed to connect to the server after " + MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS + " attempts.");
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                attempts++;
                logger.log(Level.WARNING, "IOException occurred while connecting to the server. Reason: " + e.getMessage());
                if (attempts >= MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS) {
                    logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "Failed to connect to the server after " + MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS + " attempts.");
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public void disconnect() {
        try {
            socket.close();
            logger.log(Level.INFO, "Successfully disconnected from the server.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            logger.log(Level.WARNING, "IOException occurred while disconnecting from the server. Reason: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public boolean isConnected() {
        return socket != null && socket.isConnected();
    }
}
In this implementation, the SocketAsyncConnectionChannel class has a constructor that takes the host and port of the server to connect to. The connect method tries to connect to the server using a TLS socket connection. If a SocketException or IOException occurs, it logs a warning message and retries the connection up to three times. If it fails to connect after three attempts, it logs a severe message. The disconnect method closes the socket connection and logs a message if the disconnection is successful. The isConnected method checks if the socket is not null and is connected.

Note: This implementation assumes that the SSL certificate of the server is trusted and valid. If the certificate is not trusted or valid, you may need to implement additional code to handle the SSLHandshakeException.

What is the down side of the above answer and how can it be improved.

There are a few potential downsides to the above answer that could be improved:

Limited exception handling: The current implementation catches only SocketException and IOException while connecting to the server. However, there could be other exceptions that may occur, such as SSLHandshakeException. It's a good practice to handle all possible exceptions explicitly and log them appropriately to help with debugging in case of errors.

Lack of connection timeout: The socket.connect() method doesn't have a timeout specified, which means that it will wait indefinitely until the connection is established. It's a good practice to add a connection timeout to avoid blocking the thread indefinitely.

Resource management: The current implementation doesn't close the socket in case of an exception while connecting. This could lead to resource leakage and affect the application's performance. It's a good practice to close the socket and release any resources used in the connection process, including SSLContext and SSLSocketFactory.

No handling of connection failures: The current implementation retries connecting to the server three times, but it doesn't handle the case where all connection attempts fail. In such a scenario, the application will continue running without a valid connection to the server, leading to undefined behavior.

To improve the above answer, we could make the following changes:

Add explicit exception handling for all possible exceptions that could occur during the connection process, including SSLHandshakeException.

Add a connection timeout to the socket.connect() method to avoid blocking the thread indefinitely.

Close the socket and release any resources used in the connection process, including SSLContext and SSLSocketFactory.

Add handling for connection failures, such as throwing a custom exception or logging an error message to notify the application that it's unable to connect to the server.

Here's an updated implementation of the SocketAsyncConnectionChannel class that incorporates these changes:

java
Copy code
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketAddress;
import java.net.SocketException;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException;

public class SocketAsyncConnectionChannel {
    private static final int MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS = 3;
    private final String host;
    private final int port;
    private Socket socket;
    
    public SocketAsyncConnectionChannel(String host, int port) {
        this.host = host;
        this.port = port;
    }

    public void connect() throws IOException {
        int attempts = 0;
        while (attempts < MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS) {
            SSLSocket sslSocket = null;
            try {
                SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getDefault();
                SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = sslContext.getSocketFactory();
                SocketAddress socketAddress = new InetSocketAddress(host, port);
                sslSocket = (SSLSocket) sslSocketFactory.createSocket();
                sslSocket.setSoTimeout(5000); // Set a 5-second timeout
                sslSocket.connect(socketAddress);
                this.socket = sslSocket;
                break;
            } catch (SSLHandshakeException e) {
                throw new IOException("SSLHandshakeException occurred while connecting to the server. Reason: " + e.getMessage());
            } catch (IOException e) {
                attempts++;
                if (attempts >= MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS) {
                    throw new IOException("Failed to connect to the server after " + MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS + " attempts.", e);
                }
            } finally {
                if (sslSocket != null && !sslSocket.isConnected()) {
                    sslSocket.close();
                }
            }
        }
    }

How to inject Keystone and truststore certificate into the about answers. Make use of Pre loaded  class that will Load them to a java application 

To inject the Keystone and truststore certificates into the Socket Async Connection Channel implementation, we can use the KeyStore class and TrustManagerFactory class in Java.

Assuming that the Keystone and truststore certificates are already loaded into the Java application as files, we can use the following code to load them into a KeyStore object:

java
Copy code
String keystonePath = "/path/to/keystone.jks";
String keystonePassword = "keystonePassword";
String truststorePath = "/path/to/truststore.jks";
String truststorePassword = "truststorePassword";

KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");
try (InputStream keystoreInputStream = new FileInputStream(keystonePath)) {
    keystore.load(keystoreInputStream, keystonePassword.toCharArray());
}

KeyStore truststore = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");
try (InputStream truststoreInputStream = new FileInputStream(truststorePath)) {
    truststore.load(truststoreInputStream, truststorePassword.toCharArray());
}
Next, we need to create a TrustManagerFactory object using the loaded truststore:

java
Copy code
TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
trustManagerFactory.init(truststore);
Finally, we can create an SSLContext object and configure it with the loaded keystone and truststore certificates:

java
Copy code
KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
keyManagerFactory.init(keystore, keystonePassword.toCharArray());

SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
sslContext.init(keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(), trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), new SecureRandom());
To use the SSLContext object in the SocketAsyncConnectionChannel class, we can modify the connect() method to accept the SSLContext object as a parameter:

java
Copy code
public void connect(SSLContext sslContext) throws IOException {
    int attempts = 0;
    while (attempts < MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS) {
        SSLSocket sslSocket = null;
        try {
            SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = sslContext.getSocketFactory();
            SocketAddress socketAddress = new InetSocketAddress(host, port);
            sslSocket = (SSLSocket) sslSocketFactory.createSocket();
            sslSocket.setSoTimeout(5000); // Set a 5-second timeout
            sslSocket.connect(socketAddress);
            this.socket = sslSocket;
            break;
        } catch (SSLHandshakeException e) {
            throw new IOException("SSLHandshakeException occurred while connecting to the server. Reason: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            attempts++;
            if (attempts >= MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS) {
                throw new IOException("Failed to connect to the server after " + MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS + " attempts.", e);
            }
        } finally {
            if (sslSocket != null && !sslSocket.isConnected()) {
                sslSocket.close();
            }
        }
    }
}
To use this modified connect() method, we need to pass the SSLContext object to the connect() method when calling it:

java
Copy code
SocketAsyncConnectionChannel channel = new SocketAsyncConnectionChannel("hostname", 1234);
channel.connect(sslContext);
With these changes, the Socket Async Connection Channel implementation can now use the Keystone and truststore certificates to establish an SSL/TLS connection to the server.

Write a bootstrap class for spring boot application that will Load after all spring boot loader class is done Call TSLCertLoader that will Load the the both Keystone and truststore certificate into an application so that Socket Async Connection channel and connect success 

To load the Keystone and truststore certificates into a Spring Boot application, we can create a bootstrap class that implements the org.springframework.boot.SpringApplicationRunListener interface. This class will be invoked by the Spring Boot framework after all the standard Spring Boot loader classes have been executed.

Here's an example of a bootstrap class that loads the Keystone and truststore certificates:
